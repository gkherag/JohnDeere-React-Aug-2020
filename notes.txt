Language Categories
    Line Oriented
    Procedural
    Object Based
    Object Oriented
    Functional
        functions are first class citizens
        functions can be treated like data (object)


    static
    dynamic

    strongly typed
    loosely typed




class Employee{
    public int id;
    public string name;
    public float salary;
}

Employee emp = new Employee();
emp.id = 200;
emp.city = 'Bangalore'



int x = 0;

x = "asfddaf"

var x ;

x = 100;
x = 'abc';
x = true;
x = {}
x = function(){}


arguments, this
arguments
    => array like object
        arguments[0]
        arguments[1]
        arguments.length

this 
    => invocation context

In JS, it doesnot matter who owns the function or where the function is
        what matters is how the function is invoked
    
Function invocation patterns
    As a method of an obj
        then this => obj

    As a function
        then this => global scope (window in the browser)

    Using the 'call' method of the function

    Using the 'apply' method of the function
